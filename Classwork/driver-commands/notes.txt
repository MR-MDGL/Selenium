conditional commands return's either true or false

is displayed                if displayed returnes true          generally used for website logo
is enabled                  if we can perform action or not        don't use it with logo of website(click,cheackbox,is)
is selected                 for radio buttons and cheack boxes  if button clicked manually while running and we cheack here it will give false
                               only return true when automated by script
driver.quit()               close all windows opened




navigational commands
driver.refresh()
driver.forword()
driver.back()



find element            returnes single variable
                           if it used and it found no element --- returnes exception 'no such element'
findelements            returnes multiple elements in form of  a list
                        if it used and it found no element --- returnes nothing
                        if print(len)----0

text vs get attribute
text----------if elemt located .text use if it has no inner text it returnes nothing
get attribute-------------if elemt located .text use if it has no inner text then we can get its all attribute


eg in a serchbox we use .text we found nothing
then we entered value like t-shirts and press enter
if he acces the value then we will get out querry 't-shirts'







--------------------------------------------------------------------wait commands
Selenium Waiting Strategies
Challenges: Tests fail due to race conditions; elements may not be ready when commands run.
Dynamic Elements: Single-page apps and JavaScript can delay visibility or creation of elements.
Avoid sleep: Fixed pauses are unreliable and can extend session duration unnecessarily.
-----------------------------------------------------------Selenium Waits:

Implicit Waits: Global, waits for elements up to a set time.-----------------------
            from selenium import webdriver
            driver = webdriver.Chrome()
            driver.implicitly_wait(10)  # Waits up to 10 seconds for elements to appear


Explicit Waits: Checks specific conditions until met or timeout occurs.----------------
            from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
            from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
            from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
            driver = webdriver.Chrome()
            wait = WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=10)
            element = wait.until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.ID, "element_id")))

# Example: Using a custom condition with lambda
element = wait.until(lambda d: d.find_element(By.ID, "element_id").is_displayed())

Best Practices:
Prefer explicit waits for precise control.
Do not mix implicit and explicit waits.
